## Challenges
Doing challenges to better myself! Here are my commented solutions / work in progress.
As of 2018, currently tackling Codefights.
Working my way up into the /codefights.com/arcade and completing all the challenges.
I plan to revist my solutions at some point and refactor once I have learned more.
